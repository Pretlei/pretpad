# Pretpad
Pretpad is a macropad for personal use. It has four keys, a rotary encoder with a switch, an oled screen, two LEDs, and uses QMK firmware.
Keys opens browser, puts laptop to sleep, pause/play song, and skips song on Spotify. Rotary encoder controls volume and its switch mutes all audio. OLED Screen displays time since the macropad has been turned on, which usually correlates to time on screen.

I used 4 M3 bolts and nuts in my CAD. I don't have a soldering iron, but I hope to get one so I can use heatset inserts! It has two seperate printed pieces, a top and a bottom. Made in Fusion360.
